# Employee-Tracker


## Description
The Employee Tracker is a command-line application designed to simplify the management of a company's employee database for business owners and managers. It serves as a practical solution for interacting with information stored in databases without the need for deep technical knowledge, essentially functioning as a content management system (CMS) for employee data. This application is built from the ground up using Node.js for the runtime environment, Inquirer for handling command-line prompts and user input, and MySQL for database management. These technologies work together to provide a seamless and interactive user experience directly from the command line.

The primary goal of this application is to enable users to efficiently view, add, and update various aspects of their company's organizational structure, including departments, roles, and employee details. By offering a series of command-line prompts, the application allows users to:

View all departments, roles, and employees within the company in a well-organized table format, making it easy to understand the company's current organizational structure.
Add new departments, roles, and employees to the database, facilitating organizational growth and adaptation to changing business needs.
Update existing employee roles, allowing for dynamic role assignment based on evolving requirements and employee development.
An important aspect of this project is that it does not require deployment to a web server or cloud platform, making it accessible and straightforward to use.
